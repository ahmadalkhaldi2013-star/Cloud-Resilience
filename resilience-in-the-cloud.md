## ðŸ”¹ Resilience Lifecycle  

A repeatable process to embed resilience in every workload:  

1. **Set Objectives** â†’ Define critical apps, user stories, and resilience metrics.  
2. **Design & Implement** â†’ Understand dependencies, build DR strategies, CI/CD, safe failure.  
3. **Evaluate & Test** â†’ Load testing, DR drills, chaos engineering, synthetic testing.  
4. **Operate** â†’ Continuous monitoring, observability, event management.  
5. **Respond & Learn** â†’ Incident reviews, training, metrics reviews, and knowledge base building.  

**Action:**  
Turn this into a cycle â€” after each release or incident, revisit objectives, test, and improve.

## ðŸ”¹ Resilience Tiers  

Resilience is not one-size-fits-all. Workloads should be mapped to clear targets:  

- **Silver (99.95%)** â†’ Standard business systems.  
  - RTO: 24 hrs | RPO: 12 hrs  
- **Gold (99.99%)** â†’ Business-critical or security systems.  
  - RTO: 1 hr | RPO: 30 min  
- **Platinum (99.995%)** â†’ Critical infrastructure / national-scale systems.  
  - RTO: 15 min | RPO: 1 min  

**Action:**  
Map each workload to a tier. Donâ€™t overspend on Platinum for apps that only need Silver.

## ðŸ”¹ Architectural Patterns  

Proven approaches to withstand failure:  

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Platinum[Platinum<br/>Multi-region DBs<br/>e.g. DynamoDB Global Tables<br/>Cloud Spanner]
  Gold[Gold<br/>Multi-region replication<br/>e.g. Aurora Global DB<br/>CosmosDB]
  Silver[Silver<br/>Regional instances<br/>Basic recovery]

  Platinum --> Gold --> Silver
```

**Key Questions:**  
- How will the system handle **load spikes**?  
- How do we detect and recover from **data corruption**?  
- How do we prepare for **gray failures** (partial degradation)?  

**Action:**  
Choose patterns that match the assigned tier. Build runbooks for load, database, and service failure scenarios.

## ðŸ”¹ Building a Resilience Strategy  

A complete strategy includes:  

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Req[Requirements & Scope] --> Fail[Failure Modes]
  Fail --> Obs[Observability<br/>Metrics/Logs/Tracing]
  Obs --> Ops[Operations & Tools<br/>Runbooks, CI/CD, Chaos]
  Ops --> Req
```

**Action:**  
Document a resilience playbook for each workload with failure modes, observability dashboards, and operational runbooks.

## ðŸ”¹ Operational Practices  

Resilience is a culture as much as a design:  

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  SO[Service Ownership] --> ORR[Operational Readiness Reviews]
  ORR --> CD[Safe Continuous Deployment]
  CD --> CoE[Correction of Errors]
  CoE --> SO
```
- **Service Ownership** â†’ Teams own reliability end-to-end.  
- **Safe Continuous Deployment** â†’ Automate to reduce risk.  
- **Correction of Errors (CoE)** â†’ Root cause analysis and prevention.  
- **Operational Readiness Reviews (ORR)** â†’ Validate resilience before launch.  

**Action:**  
Make ORRs, CoEs, and service ownership standard rituals across teams.
