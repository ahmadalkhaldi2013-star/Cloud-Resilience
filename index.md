# Overview  

This site is a practical guide to building **resilient cloud systems**.  
It cuts through theory and focuses on **what you can apply**:  

- **Resilience Lifecycle** → A repeatable process: set objectives, design, test, operate, and improve.  
- **Resilience Tiers** → Silver, Gold, Platinum models with clear availability targets and RTO/RPO expectations.  
- **Architectural Patterns** → Proven cloud designs for handling load, data corruption, and gray failures.  
- **Resilience Strategy** → How to define requirements, anticipate failures, build observability, and use the right tools.  
- **Operational Practices** → Service ownership, safe deployments, correction-of-error reviews, and readiness checks to embed resilience into culture.

**Who it’s for:**  
Cloud architects, SREs, DevOps, and engineers responsible for **availability, disaster recovery, and fault tolerance** in modern cloud environments.  

**Goal:**  
Provide a clear framework to **evaluate, design, and operate workloads** that can survive failure and recover fast.
