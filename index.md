# Resilient Systems

Actionable guidance for designing **reliable, resilient, and well-operated systems**.  
Patterns over products. Actions over theory.

---

## Why this exists

For 15+ years I saved hard-won notes to external drives and left them in desk drawers—rarely revisited, and no one else learned from them.  
**This site is my public notebook** so others can use (and improve) the checklists, patterns, and diagrams I wish I’d had.

---

## What you’ll find (topics)

- **Cloud Resilience** — fault isolation, static stability, AZ independence, recovery patterns.
- **System Design** — scalability, consistency & state, backpressure, latency budgets. *(coming soon)*
- **Reliability Engineering (SRE)** — SLOs, error budgets, incident response, post-incident learning. *(coming soon)*
- **Architecture Patterns** — queues vs pub/sub, idempotency, circuit-breakers, bulkheads, retries/backoff.
- **Testing & Chaos** — load tests, dependency failure drills, game days, DR runbooks.

> Everything is **action-oriented**: each section ends with clear **Action:** lines you can paste into runbooks and design reviews.

## Who this is for

- Cloud / Solution **Architects**
- **SREs** and Platform / DevOps Engineers
- Backend Engineers who own services in prod
- Tech Leads & Engineering Managers

---

## What this is / is not

**This is**
- Cloud-agnostic principles, often illustrated with **AWS terms** (because they’re widely recognized).
- Diagrams (Mermaid), checklists, and review prompts you can reuse.

**This is not**
- Vendor docs or copy-paste Terraform/CloudFormation.
- A replacement for product documentation—use these patterns to guide **design** and **operations**.

## How to use this site

1. Skim a topic, then copy the **Action** lines into your runbooks or design reviews.  
2. Adapt the Mermaid diagrams to your context (swap AWS terms for your cloud).  
3. Schedule a quick DR/chaos drill and validate the assumptions.
