# Resilience Analysis Framework  

A repeatable standard to assess applications and guide strategies for preventing, mitigating, and recovering from failures.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use This Framework?  
- Apply a **repeatable standard** to assess resilience.  
- Guide recovery-oriented strategies for preventing, mitigating, and recovering from failures.  
- Build both **preventative and corrective controls**.  
- Ensure **observability aligns** with resilience strategy.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Desired Resilience Properties  
- **Fault Isolation** â†’ Prevent cascading failures.  
- **Sufficient Capacity** â†’ Scale workloads under load.  
- **Timely Output** â†’ Meet SLA response times.  
- **Correct Output** â†’ Ensure accurate results.  
- **Redundancy** â†’ Replication, failover, backups.  

**Action:** Validate all systems against these five core properties.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Categories of Failure (SEEMS)  
1. **Single Points of Failure** â†’ No redundancy.  
2. **Excessive Load** â†’ Not enough capacity/resources.  
3. **Excessive Latency** â†’ Requests not completing on time.  
4. **Misconfiguration & Bugs** â†’ Incorrect execution.  
5. **Shared Fate** â†’ Violated fault isolation (e.g., noisy neighbors).  

**Action:** Map each workload against SEEMS â†’ design mitigation for each category.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analysis Maturity  
- **Beginning** â†’ Component-level checks only.  
- **Application** â†’ End-to-end workload analysis.  
- **Advanced** â†’ Full **user journey** evaluation.  

**Action:** Mature resilience testing from components â†’ to workloads â†’ to user journeys.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ What Are We Analyzing?  
- End-to-end **workload architectures** (e.g., mobile in-app purchase flow).  
- Includes API gateways, databases, event-driven services, and external dependencies.  

**Action:** Always test user-visible flows, not just infrastructure pieces.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Components to Assess  
- **Code & Config** â†’ CI/CD, IaC, deployment pipelines.  
- **Infrastructure** â†’ Compute, network, storage.  
- **Data Stores** â†’ Databases, replication, caching.  
- **External Dependencies** â†’ APIs, SaaS, partner systems.  

**Action:** Maintain a resilience checklist for each category.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Resilience Trade-offs  
- **Cost & Effort** â†’ More resilience costs more.  
- **Complexity** â†’ Multi-region = harder to manage.  
- **Operational Burden** â†’ More monitoring, DR drills.  
- **Consistency & Latency** â†’ Trade-offs in distributed systems.  

**Action:** Weigh designs based on *likelihood Ã— impact*.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Weighing Trade-offs  
- **High Impact + High Likelihood** â†’ Must fix immediately.  
- **High Impact + Low Likelihood** â†’ Backups/runbooks.  
- **Low Impact + High Likelihood** â†’ Automate recovery.  
- **Low Impact + Low Likelihood** â†’ Monitor, accept risk.  

**Action:** Use a risk matrix to prioritize investments.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Failure Mode Observability  
- **Leading Indicators** â†’ Early warnings (queue depth, CPU, latency trends).  
- **Lagging Indicators** â†’ Customer-visible issues (downtime, failed requests).  

**Action:** Instrument for both â€” catch failures before users see them.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Failure Mode Mitigations  
- **Preventative** â†’ Capacity planning, failover, chaos testing.  
- **Corrective** â†’ Incident response, runbooks, rollback, hotfix.  

**Action:** Pair each failure mode with preventative + corrective controls.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Continuous Improvement  
- **Operationalize** â†’ Schedule resilience reviews and DR tests.  
- **Test** â†’ Regular chaos drills and synthetic failure injection.  
- **Learn** â†’ Post-incident reviews, update playbooks.  

**Action:** Treat resilience as an iterative lifecycle, not one-time design.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways  
- Resilience = **prevent, mitigate, recover**.  
- The framework goes beyond traditional architecture â†’ more **holistic analysis**.  
- Build a **toolbox**:  
  - Identify **failure modes**  
  - Create **observability**  
  - Define **mitigations**  
- Continuous improvement is essential.  

**Action:** Embed this framework into project reviews, DR planning, and system design docs.
